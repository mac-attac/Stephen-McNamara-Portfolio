# Stephen-McNamara-Portfolio

Here we were to implement our existing knowledge of Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS to create a portfolio website for ourselves. This task was challenging, but I am very happy with the result considering we are only a little over a week into our bootcamp. Bootstrap is a powerful tool, indeed, and makes the creation of visually appealing web pages pretty painless.

To start off, I scoured the Bootstrap documentation to try and give myself a better understanding of how it works and fit into the scope of this task. I then created three html files for each page of the website (About, Contact, and Portfolio). After copying the necessary links for cdn delivery networks, I added respective elements to each html page. I tried to use semantic tags wherever possible and create a grid layout in regard to Bootstrap set up.

All pages include the same navbar, although each page has respective components from Bootstrap to make sure there would function in an appropriate manner. The index.html file contains a container that was written out mostly by me, however. This container has a personalized picture and bio section within it. The contact.html file contains a form from Bootstrap with minor modifications to personalize it. Lastly, the portfolio.html page contains placeholder images for display of future portfolio projects. All navbar links were connected to pages within the repo itself and are functioning properly.

An HTML validation service was used to root out any browser compatibility issues that might arise. Responsiveness was also checked frequently at all stages to ensure viewing compatibility for different devices. All seemed to pass the litmus test.
